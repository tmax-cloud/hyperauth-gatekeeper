   - tls_ca_certificate -> tls-ca-certificate
   - tls_private_key    -> tls-private-key
   - tls_cert           -> tls-cert
   - log_json_format    -> log-json-format
   - log_requests       -> log-requests

FIXES:
 * Added a option to control the upstream TLS verification

 * Moved back to using the official coreos go-oidc rather than the hacked version
