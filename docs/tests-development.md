## Writing tests

When writing tests please follow the same approach as we have taken in the other tests. There are many ways to 
test software and we have chosen ours, so please appreciate that.

The main tests are provided in files with the suffix `_test.go` and can be executed by running:

    make test

When developing your test depending on the feature or enhancement you are testing you may find it best to add to an
existing test, or to write a test from scratch. For the latter, we recommend finding another test that is close to what 
you need and use that as a basis.
